# Ensure that the MODULE.bazel.lock file is complete and committed.
# This is an important security measure: it ensures that developers on the
# same rule set download dependencies at the same versions with the same bits.
# This setting does not affect modules that depend on this module.
#
# When updating dependencies, use --lockfile_mode=refresh, for example:
#     bazel mod tidy --lockfile_mode=refresh
#
# When testing different versions of Bazel, use --lockfile_mode=update or
# --lockfile_mode=off. The lock file format changes over time, and different
# versions of Bazel may expect different syntax. Bazel also implicitly requires
# some modules, and different versions have different dependencies, which
# also affects the contents of the lock file.
